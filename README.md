# Interaction-Network-Pytorch
Pytorch Implementraion of [Interaction Networks for Learning about Objects, Relations and Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00222).

*Decomposing complex systems into objects and relations, and reasoning about them explicitly, provides for combinatorial generalisation to novel contexts, one of the most important future challenges for AI, and a crucial step toward closing the gap between how humans and machines think.* 

IN is graph based framework for dynamic systems. It was able to simulate the physical trajectories of n-body, bouncing ball, and non-rigid string systems accurately over thousands of time steps, after training only on single step predictions.
